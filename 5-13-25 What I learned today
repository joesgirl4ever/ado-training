### What I Learned Today
- Learned about the shell
- First commands:
- up arrow: command history
- down arrow: previous command
- left & right arrows: navigate anywhere on cmd line
- you can copy & paste with a mouse! click & drag over desired copy, (copies into buffer). find desired paste location & click middle mouse button there to paste
- NOTE: ctrl + c & v do not work!
- think about: in window manager, changing to "focus follows mouse" (makes the copy/paste easier)
- date: gives date, time
- cal: calendar - current month
- NOTE: even if you are not in a terminal emulator (te), some te's run behind the desktop. these are virtual sessions
- ACCESS VIRTUAL SESSIONS BY: ctrl + alt + f1 thru f6 - when it comes up, put in your username & pw
- VIRTUAL SESSIONS allow you to work on multiple things simultaneously- (press alt + f1 - f6 to switch between them)
- to get out of a virtual session: (most) alt + f7
- look for free space on drive: df
- check for free memory: free
- close te session: exit (like DOS!) :)
