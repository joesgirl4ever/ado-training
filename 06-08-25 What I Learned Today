### What I Learned Today
-Just received Windows laptop to use to remote into homelab (once built).
-Setting up and identifying process via KubeCraft instructions/recommendations.
-Initializing Windows laptop
-Good news is that this laptop actually has the correct build- this time! (Had to send original one back- old customer load still present)
-Interesting experience wading through a consumer load of Windows- been a long time. (Mac user for personal)
-Got OS up, connected to network, loaded Chrome.
-Applied Windows updates
-Download Rufus to get Ubuntu Desktop onto bootable thumb drive
-Loading Ubuntu using 512GB drive
