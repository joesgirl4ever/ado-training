### What I Learned Today
-Azure Fundamentals
-Route network traffic
-AZ routes traffic betw. subnets on any connected virtual netwks, on-prem & web
-Can be overriden- routing tables, can create custom ones
-Has BGP, works with: AZvpn gtwys, route server, ExpressRoute > propogate on-prem bgp routes to az networks
-can filter network traffic- betw. subnets via netwok security groups
-based upon source or dest. ip, or port, protoocol
-server: 8080
-proxy: 8081
-SQL: 1433, 1434, 2382,2383,80
-network virt. appliances- like hw.
-runs firewall, WAN opt.
-connecting virtual netwks:
-virt. ntwk peering
-traff. betw. peers is private, MS backbone, never on web
-peered virt. ntwks can be in diff regions
-can connect globally, thru az
-user defined routes- controls tables betw. subnets, allows for greater traff. flw ctrl
-config. network access
-JSON issue with extention used to install Nginx in vm- parsed by shell
-found tool: https://jsonlint.com. will investigate >>>
-az private networks:
-vpn uses encrypted tunnel in another network
-usually used to connect 2 or more trusted private ntwks
-vpn gatewy- deployed in dedicated subnet of the virt. ntwk
-site-to-site: on-prem to dc's
-point-to-site: indiv. device to virt. ntwk
-netwk-to-netwk: conn. virt. ntwk to virt. ntwk
-note: only 1 vpn van be deployed in a virt. netwk.
-however, that one vpn can connect to multiple locations
-when setting up vpn, must be either: policy-based or route-based
-in az, authentication is pre-shared key
-policy-based vpn: static ip for encryption
-End
