### What I Learned Today
-Created my first blog entry on Medium: https://medium.com/@frostmaiden_68155/my-journey-to-azure-devops-ed78bd1a83a0
-Continuing Azure Devops training for AZ900 certificaiton on MSFT Learn
-Using Rocketbook for notes (loving this tool- handwriting helps me retain, but then I can save digitally)
-Also using Mischa van den Burg's (Kubecraft) article: "The Tech Professional's Guide to Accelerated Learning"
-Azure Compute & Networking Services
-Virtual machines: Ideal for total control over OS, running custom sw, custom hosting config.
-Can use pre-existing image to rapidly configure VM's, use scale sets to create & manage group of identical VM's
-Availability sets- prevents loss of all VM's due to network or power failure
-Availability sets group VM's- Update domain & fault domain
-Update domains are groups of Vm's that can update at the same time
-Fault domains group VM's by common power source & network switch
-By default, availability groups are split into 3 fault domains to protect against outages
-You can use VM's to run apps in the cloud, extend from on-prem DC to cloud, disaster recovery
-Lift & shifts (DC to cloud)
-When you provision a VM, you need to pick the resources associated to it: Size: purpose, # of processors, RAM
-Storage: Hard disks, solid state dr's, etc.
-Networking: virtual, public IP, port config.
-Exercise: Create Linux VM & install Nginx on it
-Last status: Having trouble with JSON. Need to evaluate. Shell session in Sandbox timing out as well- coming back at it tomorrow.
