### What I Learned Today
-Linux (via LabEx)
-Opening the terminal
-Using the terminal
-echo: prints text
-whoami: current user
-id: displays user & group info
-sudo apt install (then put app name): installs the app
-htop: system process viewer (more feature-rich than top)
-pwd: (print working directory)- your current location in the file system
-ls: see contents of current directory
- ~: home directory
-touch: creates an empty file
- > redirects output of echo to a file (Putting filename after it either updates contents or creates it)
- . prefacing filename hides it
-mkdir: creates directory
-ls -a: shows hidden files
-ls -la: shows all files in long format
-cp: copy a file
- -r: recursive- must use when copying directories (so everything's copied)
