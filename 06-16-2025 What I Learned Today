### What I Learned Today
-LINUX STUDIES
-Current kernel: 2.xxx (1996)
-Distro's are bundles of apps & tools
-Basically, everything is case-sensitive
-$ prompt for normal users
-# prompt for root, or super users
-Can vary by Distro, but usually these two
-PW changes: Root user can always change anyone's pw- other users may only chg their own
-passwd: To change pw. You'll get prompted for the old one, (unless you are root, then you have to specify the user who's pw you want to change
-Then, once old pw entered, you have to type new one in twice. You'll get ack when successful.
-logout (or exit): logs you out. Remember to do this when done!
-The shell: Can run scripts in here,(Bourne Again Shell = bash)= DEFAULT shell in Linux (C shell is for those versed in c)
-/bin: shells live in here
-Shells are not cross-compatible
-echo $SHELL: find what shell is. (Results will look like: "/bin/bash", etc. Other shells might display.
-General syntax in any shell: command [options] [parameters]
-Command: What you want to do
-Options: (Aka: switches), modify the behavior of the command, typically proceeded by a hyphen (-).
-Parameters: (Aka: arguments), = data or files the command needs to act on or with.
-NOTE: Multiple commands can be run on one line, separated by a semi-colon (;). Ex: "who;uptime"
-Users & Groups: (3) primary commands: 
-useradd
-usdermod 
-userdel
-All user info stored in: etc/passwd, except for the user's encrypted pw.
-All pw info is stored in: etc/shadow.
-Group info: Stored in: etc/group, EXCEPT FOR user's primary group, which is stored in: etc/passwd.
-Syntax to use all 3: command [option(s)] username.
-Common for useradd: -g <group name or number>, (user's primary group), -G <group name or number> Other groups the user belongs to.
-Also for useradd: -m creates home dir if it doesn't already exist
-Also for useradd: -u <UID> user ID, default is next available.
-For usermod: all as with add, but no -m. (Also -l switch to change user's login name.'
-For userdel: Only one switch: -r, which will remove user's home dir & everything in it! (Check the contents FIRST!)
